# JavaScript-Code-Quiz
At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I'll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. To help familiarize myself with these tests and allow myself to use the skills I have gained, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface,
